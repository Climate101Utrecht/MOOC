## In order to be able to create content, we first need to ask ourselves a few questions and decide on some key aspects. 

*This means that:*
1. We need an overall structure/style of each module/faculty. 
  * Introduction to the module, really shortly. (15 min)
  * Lecture 1 + 2 (1hr)
  * Reading 1 (1hr)
  * Small quiz (15 min)
  * Lecture 3 + 4 (1hr)
  * Reading 2 (1hr)
  * Interactive game/aspect (30 min)
  * Small quiz (15 min)
  * Excercise (1hr)
  * Lecture 5 + 6 (1hr)
  * Reading 3 (1hr)
  * Continue excercise (1hr)
  * Lecture 7 + 8 (1hr)
  * Mid-term examination (30 min)
  
>Maybe something along these lines? This defeats the purpose of having 20-30 min lectures, but I'm not sure yet how to create interesting content in between two lectures.
 
2. What kind of course material are we looking for? E.g. papers, interactive games etc.Also, how many hours dedicated to lectures? How many hours for self-study (readings etc.)
 * We propose 8 short lectures of Â±20-30 minutes (like 4 hours in total). This helps to keep the attention of the user. The lectures do not all have to have a different topic. 
  * We will have to search for self-study readings (worth like 5 hours of reading). This is primarily to delve deeper into the topic matter. 
  * If possible, it would be great to have some interactive aspect in the module. As of now it will be difficult to interact with other people who take the course (mainly technical, but also organizitory it is difficult). There are many games, models, and other things out there that are interactive, but it should really have added value. So don't do it if it's just for the sake of the interactivity.
 
3. Think of connecting the dots by bridging each module/faculty lectures with an introduction lecture at the beginning and a wrap-up lecture at the end to bridge into the next module/faculty/discipline. This again creates extra coherency across the whole course. 

5. Come up with approx. 2-5 learning aims for your chosen module (What should the student have learned after completing this module? Take home message etc.) As a suggestion, go to a first-year course in Osiris and then you'll see the level of aims you have to be thinking about. This link is also very informative: 
([see https://teaching.uncc.edu/teaching-guides/course-design/writing-measurable-course-objectives]()) 


**Just to stress again, it is incredibly important to make sure we have identified the learning aims and topics** before we start to develop the real content. The learning aims are the building blocks, the main motivation of the content. Hence, if that's not properly developed, it is very difficult to create good content. 


### **Hence, the to-do's for this week are:**
- [ ] Write up learning goals
- [ ] Think of interesting topics
- [ ] Think of links to other modules, to create this integrated approach





#### What do we want to achieve with this module?

This module is meant to give the user a first insight in the diversity of sustainability. 
Get the person interested to follow the whole course. 
etc.

#### What should we include in this module? 

The common definition of sustainability
Relevance for sustainability
Introduction to the modules and course
The first course should probably show the modules and the structure of the course, along with what the goal is of this course.

etc.

In the history part we could include Jared Diamond's "Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed", as well as Garett Hardin's famous short paper on the "Tragedy of the Commons"
