### What do we want to achieve with this module? 

### What should we include in this module?


- [ ] Biocentric philosophies, such as **deep ecology** and *ecofeminism*.
- [ ] Trying to explain how our current worldview (neoliberal capitalism) is a Western idea, and how this is leading to a lot of environmental destruction. --> *this also sort of crosses over into economics though, if we want to think about our economic goal being the endless growth of GDP, which a lot of ecological economists (see Kate Raworths' Doughnut Economics) say is unsustainable.*
- [ ] Examining how people living in poverty in developing countries will actually be the first and worst hit by climate change. 
- [ ] Maybe we could even mention the future prospects of climate refugees?
- [ ] What impact the meat/dairy, transport, and fast-fashion industries are having on the environment.

> I think I would just like to try and draw people's attention to how our whole society is based on ideals of capitalist consumption, and how these ideas are so deeply ingrained that we contribute without even knowing, or seeing another way e.g. by buying lots of new clothes, eating meat, taking planes for a two day holiday, etc. And I want to make the point that by not taking climate change seriously, we are really making decisions about other people's livelihoods, e.g. those in developing countries who will be the worst hit. Mostly, I would like people to be aware that there are alternative philosophies to live by that our whole society could shift towards. 
> So basically, if this module could make people think about our society and way of life from a different perspective.

###### **Possible Assignments**

- [ ] Get people to take a 20 minute walk through a park, or just the city streets, and pick up every piece of trash they see. Consider all of this ending up in the ocean, and then scale that up to every city in the Netherlands, every country in Europe, and finally the whole world. 
They would then have to take a picture of all the trash they collected, upload it to the MOOC, and write a short 300 word paragraph about their thoughts on it.
- [ ] Provide students with a short, multichoice quiz that they give to one of their peers. An example question from such a quiz might be "what percentage of mammalian species have gone extinct since the 70s? 10%, 20%, or 45%?" Hopefully both the student of the MOOC and their peer would learn something, and it would start a discussion between them, not to mention provide easy facts that they could then tell others. They would need to write a 500-1000 word essay on the thoughts/discussion points the quiz raised.
- [ ] Write a one to two page piece of creative writing, imagining that they are a) a climate refugee having to flee their home due to it becoming uninhabitable, or b) an animal living in a rural area that is rapidly becoming urbanised.
- [ ] Interview a friend/family member about their views on the environment and climate change. We could provide an interview format with questions such as "are you worried about climate change? What do you think we can do as individuals? What do you think is the root of the problem?"
- [ ] Go outside and take pictures or draw three of the most beautiful/interesting natural things you see. Contemplate their right to exist and think about what impact climate change might have on them.
