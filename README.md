# MOOC

Hello reader! 

Welcome to the Massive Open Online Course organized by the Climate101 Utrecht department and thank you for your interest in this project! 

If you would like to know more about climate101, you can go to https://climate101.net or you can email utrechtclimate101@gmail.com. 

*// INTRODUCTION //*
This Massive Open Online Course is intented to be an introductory course on sustainability and ecosystem impact topics. However, it is not just pure climate science from various perspectives; this course ought to teach the user about sustainability and ecosystem impacts in one's own fields of expertise. This can be economics, law, sociology, mathematics, and many more. This will enable the user to put in practic some of the fundamentals applicable in one's field of study, or to just get a more holistic view on sustainability and ecosystem impacts.

*// WHO CONTRIBUTES WHAT? //*
This course is intended to be designed by students and the content will ideally be provided by professors who are an expert in their field. In specific, we are looking for learning material (e.g. recorded lectures, literature, other online materials) and questions to test users on their comprehension.
Students will design the content of the course. Firstly, one needs to think about what subject is relevant to this course (which are many). Then, approach professors with a request if they would like to contribute to this project. Clearly explain the goals of this course. 

*// HOW CAN YOU CONTRIBUTE VIA GITHUB? //*
1. Make a GitHub account, so you can participate in the GitHub project.
2. If you have already not done so yet, you can reach out to utrechtclimate101@gmail.com to get in touch with the admins of the project. They will be able to give you additional information about current and future plans and they can indicate where you can best contribute to. 
3. Create a new branch from the section you are working on, which is called a pull request. This will create a copy of the original section, with which you can later merge your work. Merging the branch to the original section goes via 'merge pull request'. This indicates that your work is done, hence it will be reviewed by others. If it is approved, your work will be merged. IMPORTANT: Do not directly edit the master branch. Always, always create a new branch for new edits!
4. When you commit changes to your branch, make sure to give your edit a title and a short but informative description of what you have done. This will make it much easier for yourself and for others to keep track of the changes committed. 

Other tasks which are often overlooked:
* Review code on other people’s submissions.
* Write and improve the project’s documentation.
* Curate a folder of examples showing how the project is used.
* Answer questions about the project on, for example, Stack Overflow,
Keep things organized by:
* Linking to duplicate issues.
* Suggesting new issue labels.
* Going through open issues and suggesting closing old ones.
* Ask clarifying questions on recently opened issues to move the discussion forward.

*// WHAT IS THE PLANNING OF THIS PROJECT? //*
Climate101 would like to have a first draft by April, 2020. This should include input from several professors (±5 would be great).
As this project is open-source and anyone can commit changes, there is no specific final product in mind. This is largely due to the fact that it is unknown how many and which professors are willing or able to contribute.
Climate101 Utrecht department is a flexible group of students, which means that the project goes on for as long as necessary. Next academic years there will be new people contributing in place of people who are not available anymore.
